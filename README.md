In ubuntu, skype icons are stored in /usr/share/skypeforlinux/resources/app.asar.unpacked/images/tray/linux/ when installing skype from the aptpitude package manager.

If you have a black/white or dark theme you may not like the standard icons. I have updated these icons to support an icon trey which has black/white icons.

To install, simply drag these files into  /usr/share/skypeforlinux/resources/app.asar.unpacked/images/tray/linux/ and overwrite the existing files there. 

Works in ubuntu 22.04.
